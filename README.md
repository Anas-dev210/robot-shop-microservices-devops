âœ… What we have now:

Repo scaffold created and pushed.

.gitignore added (covering NodeJS, Java, Python, Golang, PHP, DBs, etc.).

Branching strategy finalized (main, develop, feature/*, optional release/*, hotfix/*).

Branch protection rules applied on main & develop.

ðŸ‘‰ Next logical step:
We can start filling the repo with real service code + Dockerfiles + Kubernetes manifests (following the folder structure).
